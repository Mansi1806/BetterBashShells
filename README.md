# BetterBashShells

**Variations to Mitigate Bash Limitations**

This repository contains a collection of custom shell variations designed to address specific limitations of Bash, the widely-used Unix shell. Each variation aims to enhance functionality, improve performance, or boost security.

**Purpose**

The goal of this project is to develop custom shell versions that overcome critical shortcomings of Bash, providing more robust and effective alternatives for different user needs.

**Key Shell Variations and Features**

**1. DebugShell**
Features:
Advanced debugging tools, step-by-step execution tracing, error highlighting, and a verbose mode.
Tools/Tech:
Custom logging framework, error handling library, GDB integration.
Metrics:
Number of detected errors, average debugging time, user feedback on error clarity.

**2. SafeShell**
Features:
Secure execution with sandboxing, input sanitization, and safe mode operations.
Tools/Tech:
Seccomp for sandboxing, AppArmor/SELinux for access control, input validation libraries.
Metrics:
Security audit score, successful mitigation of unauthorized access attempts.

**3. SpeedShell**
Features:
Performance-focused with optimizations like command caching, multi-threading support, and efficient resource management.
Tools/Tech:
POSIX Threads, custom memory management routines, caching mechanisms.
Metrics:
Command execution time, memory usage, CPU load, performance benchmarks against Bash.

**Goals and Objectives**

Provide enhanced shell alternatives to address critical Bash limitations.
Improve debugging, security, and performance for diverse use cases.
Promote best practices in scripting and shell usage.
